# Kaffee BITter

With the help of an ESP32, a Loadcell and the HX711 ADC Amplifier, we have built a scale that determines and displays the fill level of the coffee pot in the IuE Fachschaft:  

[Coffee](https://fsie-kiel.de/coffee)

## Installation
  
Software:
- [ESP-IDF](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/)
- [HX711 Libary](https://esp-idf-lib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/groups/hx711.html)
  
Hardware:  
- ESP32  
- [HX711 Loadcell](https://www.reichelt.de/de/de/entwicklerboards-a-d-wandler-waage-10-kg-debo-hx711-10-p316339.html?PROVID=2788&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI-M7jjLfOgwMVpZ9oCR2JgADwEAQYASABEgIWA_D_BwE&&r=1)

## How does it Work
Hardware:

1. You have to build a [scale](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-load-cell-hx711/) with the loadcell and the HX711 amplifier 
2. A coffee can or similar 

Software:
1. Change in the menuconfig the weight of your coffee can and the size of your cups
2. Connect your ESP32 to your WI-FI
3. Define your API-Endpoint
4. Build an Aplication to show the value of the scale:  
{"state":"filled","temperature":"hot","cups":5,"stamp":"2024-01-08T14:27:11.000Z"}

## Pin Config:
- GND (BLACK) to GND
- DT (Weight) to 19
- SCK (Yellow) to 18
- VCC (RED) to 3v3
